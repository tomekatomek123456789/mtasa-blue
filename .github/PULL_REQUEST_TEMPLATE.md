Before you go ahead and create a pull request, please make sure:

* [ ] [your code follows the coding guidelines](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/index.php?title=Coding_guidelines)
* [ ] your commit messages are informative ("update file.cpp" is unhelpful. "fix missing model in getVehicleNameFromModel" is helpful)

If your work is incomplete, **do not prefix your pull request with "WIP"**, instead
create a _draft_ pull request: https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/

Thank you!
